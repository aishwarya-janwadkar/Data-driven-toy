Data driven waiting room toy

This interactive 3-dimensional Waiting Room Toy explores how climate data could be represented through 3-dimensional tangible objects in order to make data more accessible and easily readable by all ages.

The raw data sets are acquired from NOAA and NASA websites for sea-level rise, change in CO2 levels, and rise in average global temperatures from 1880 to 2010. I cleaned up the raw data to be easily inputted into a line-graph code that is open source on my github.

Waiting Room Toy project aims to explore objects and technology as subjects instead of considering them solely as tools and aims to create an interaction between natural systems (climate and weather) and technological systems (data sets and visualizations).
